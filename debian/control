Package: llvm
Architecture: any
Depends: llvm-runtime (= ${binary:Version}), llvm-${pv:llvm} ${reqv:llvm}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)
 The Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a collection of libraries and
 tools that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, Just-In-Time
 code generators, and many other compiler-related programs.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default llvm package.

 tools that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, Just-In-Time
 code generators, and many other compiler-related programs.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default bytecode interpreter.

Description: Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM), libraries and headers
 The Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a collection of libraries and
 tools that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, Just-In-Time
 code generators, and many other compiler-related programs.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default libraries and headers.

Package: libllvm-ocaml-dev
Architecture: any
Section: ocaml
Depends: llvm-runtime (= ${binary:Version}), libllvm-${pv:llvm}-ocaml-dev ${reqv:llvm}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM), bindings for OCaml
 The Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a collection of libraries and
 tools that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, Just-In-Time
 code generators, and many other compiler-related programs.
 .

Package: clang
Architecture: any
Depends: clang-${pv:llvm} ${reqv:llvm}, ${misc:Depends}
Replaces: clang (<< 3.2-1~exp2), clang-3.2, clang-3.3, clang-3.4 (<< 1:3.4.2-7~exp1),
 clang-3.5 (<< 1:3.5~+rc1-3~exp1)

Description: C, C++ and Objective-C compiler (LLVM based)
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end
 for the LLVM compiler. Its goal is to offer a replacement to the GNU Compiler
 Collection (GCC).
 .
 Clang implements all of the ISO C++ 1998 and 2001 standards and also provides
 a partial support of C++1y.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default clang compiler.

Description: C, C++ and Objective-C compiler (LLVM based)
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end
 for the LLVM compiler. Its goal is to offer a replacement to the GNU Compiler
 Collection (GCC).
 .
 Clang implements all of the ISO C++ 1998 and 2001 standards and also provides
 a partial support of C++1y.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default clang libraries.
 .
 The C Interface to Clang provides a relatively small API that exposes
 facilities for parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST),
 loading already-parsed ASTs, traversing the AST, associating physical source
 locations with elements within the AST, and other facilities that support
 Clang-based development tools.

Package: libclang-dev
Architecture: any
Section: libdevel
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${dep:devlibs},
 libclang-${pv:llvm}-dev ${reqv:llvm}
Description: clang library - Development package
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end
 for the LLVM compiler. Its goal is to offer a replacement to the GNU Compiler
 Collection (GCC).
 .
 Clang implements all of the ISO C++ 1998 and 2001 standards and also provides
 a partial support of C++1y.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default libclang libraries and
 headers.

Package: lldb
Architecture: any
Depends: lldb-${pv:llvm} ${reqv:llvm}, ${misc:Depends}
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Description: Next generation, high-performance debugger
 LLDB is a next generation, high-performance debugger. It is built as a set of
 reusable components which highly leverage existing libraries in the larger LLVM
 Project, such as the Clang expression parser and LLVM disassembler.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default version of lldb.
